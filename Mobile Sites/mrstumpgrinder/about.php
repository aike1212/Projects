					<big class="block"><strong>LOCATION:</strong></big>
					If you bring your stumps to my place, I work real cheap! (think about that) Or... I will come to your place for a fair price if you are willing to wait on my travel schedule. Quality work at a fair price motivates many repeat customers to call and get on my work list for the next trip to their area. They also sometimes line up other potential jobs.

					<big class="block"><strong>CALENDAR YEAR:</strong></big>
					I like to say, "If you are between Grayling, MI and the Gulf Coast of MS, you are in my district! I typically work <strong>April</strong> through <strong>December</strong> in southern Michigan and northern Ohio/Indiana. I do summer stayover trips to Grayling, MI and Siren, WI. <br />
					<br />
					<strong>January, February,</strong> and <strong>March</strong> travel includes key locations in a warmer climate. Often I do jobs enroute between my stayover spots. Contact me to see when I'm coming your way. Stayover spots include: Bellefontaine, OH; <strong>Pigeon Forge &amp; Coker Creek, TN; Biloxi, MS;</strong> Joplin &amp; Branson, MO; Fayetteville, AR; Tallequah, OK.
