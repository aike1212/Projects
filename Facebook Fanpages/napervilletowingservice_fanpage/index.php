	<div id="inner-content">
		<p>Classic Towing provides 24-hour towing service, collision recovery, and roadside assistance throughout Chicago specializing in the Naperville-Aurora, IL area.  Our friendly, uniformed drivers will safely tow your vehicle from the Naperville-Aurora region to anywhere in Chicagoland, the state of Illinois, or its neighboring states. </p>
		<p>With Classic Towing  you can experience the newest technology in the towing industry with our eco-friendly, green emissions Hino flatbed tow trucks. These tow trucks have low profile beds which sit much lower than standard flatbed tow trucks.  This clearance allows such an incline to load vehicles with very low ground clearance without damaging the bumper, valance, or exhaust.  To further ensure damage-free towing we are able to employ a soft nylon tie-down system with no hooks or chains to pull, bend, or scratch the vehicle. </p>
		<p>Here at Classic Towing we understand that the need for a tow is a stressful situation and an unwanted headache. Don't add to your stress by trusting your vehicle to some second rate, under-insured towing company. If you want the job done right, give our Naperville-Aurora based towing service a call and have no worries as we guarantee your vehicle, tool box, or freight will be safely transported to its destination on-time and at a reasonable price!  </p>
