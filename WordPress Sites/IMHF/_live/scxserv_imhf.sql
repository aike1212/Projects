Though there are hundreds of people around the globe organizing WordCamps, WordPress meetups, hackathons, free classes and the like, since their &#8220;projects&#8221; were all happening locally there was never a central hub of activity for these folks. Despite the many informal connections between community organizers, we weren&#8217;t taking advantage of the huge existing knowledge base as new organizers stepped up to the plate.</p>\n<p>With the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/">this new contributor group</a>, we finally have a way to organize and recognize these kinds of contributions, a clear avenue for feedback and input when it comes to policies around official events, and the opportunity to create even more connections between community organizers through mentorship programs and group projects. I&#8217;m especially excited about the creation of this group because until now the role of community organizer, while one of the most important, has not gotten the same recognition as higher-profile contribution methods such as forum support or core code contribution. That is something I hope this group will change, and the local organizers can be recognized for the community leaders they are.*</p>\n<p>If you are the organizer of a local WordCamp, WordPress meetup, etc., head over to <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/">http://make.wordpress.org/events/</a> and introduce yourself so we can include you in the fun!</p>\n<p>Speaking of meetups, an update on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/">my last post about meetups</a> is long overdue. With around 500 meetup organizers (and/or potential organizers) responding to my last survey, it took much longer than anticipated to review all the responses. We&#8217;re working now with meetup.com to issue invitations to join a centralized WordPress Meetup account, so if you filled out the form earlier this year, you should be hearing from them soon. The first wave of existing meetup account transfers (for those who opted in) should happen in the next two weeks, with additional waves every 3 months thereafter (and new groups will be able to be created along the way).</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/">contributor summit</a> that is being planned for the end of October also generated hundreds of responses/nominations, so that review process is still happening, but we should be announcing some basic plans and issuing invitations soon.</p>\n<p>And finally, it would be impossible to talk about in-person WordPress events without mentioning the upcoming annual <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WordCamp in San Francisco</a>. As the event that represents the worldwide project as a whole, it&#8217;s the perfect time to evaluate where we stand as a project and as a community, to help determine where we go next. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, developer, or in any way a part of our vast and interconnected ecosystem, please take a moment to fill in the <a href="http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2012">2nd annual WordPress survey</a>. It&#8217;s just a couple of questions, and your input would be greatly appreciated. The results of the survey will be announced at <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WSCF</a>, and a report issued shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>*<em> I am also of the firm belief that academic and arts activities should earn varsity letters just like sports teams do &#8212; go mathletes! </em></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/07/event-organizers-unite/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:45:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress 3.4.1 Maintenance and Security Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:57:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2383";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:379:"WordPress 3.4.1 is now available for download.

For themes that support it, you can change colors, backgrounds, and of course custom image headers. We have more planned for the customizer down the road.</p>\n<p>Throughout the rest of the admin you&#8217;ll notice tweaks to make your everyday life easier. For example, if you have lots of themes we&#8217;ve made it quicker to browse them all at once without paging. We&#8217;ve made it possible to use images from your media library to populate custom headers, and for you to choose the height and width of your header images.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve expanded our embed support to include tweets: just put a Twitter permalink on its own line in the post editor and we&#8217;ll turn it into a beautiful embedded Tweet. And finally, image captions have been improved to allow HTML, like links, in them.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There are hundreds of under-the-hood improvements in this release, notably in the XML-RPC, themes, and custom header APIs, and significant performance improvements in WP_Query and the translation system. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.4">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features</a>, and you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.4">dive into Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/wordpress-3-4-field-guide-for-developers/">put together a busy developer&#8217;s field guide to the new APIs in 3.4</a>.</p>\n<h3>It takes a village</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the fine folks who were involved in bringing 3.4 to the world:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/082net">082net</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

There are over <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">19,000 plugins listed</a> and they&#8217;re really the heart and soul of WordPress for many people, so they deserve a little tender loving care. Here&#8217;s a quick before and after snapshot you can zoom in on to see a visual overview of some of the changes:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png"><img src="http://s2.wp.com/imgpress?resize=690,350&amp;url=http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png&amp;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3" alt="" /></a></p>\n<p>Our first focus was around improving the discussion and support around plugins.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now notice that threads about a plugin are pulled directly into a &#8220;support&#8221; tab on the plugin page &#8212; each plugin has its own forum. We&#8217;ve made authors much more prominent and with bigger Gravatars and better placement, so you can get a sense of who made the plugin you&#8217;re using. And finally to show how active and well-supported a plugin is, you can see  &#8221;16 of 75 support threads in the last two weeks have been resolved.&#8221; Finally, if you&#8217;re logged in you get access to the new &#8220;favorites&#8221; feature that lets you mark the plugins you use the most so you can share them on your profile page and find them quickly later. We soft-launched favorites a few days ago and there have already been 2,000 saved!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a plugin author, we&#8217;ve started with a short threshold (2 weeks) for the resolved stats so it&#8217;s easy to catch up and stay on top of it. (It&#8217;ll eventually go to two months.) You also now have the ability to set stickies on your plugin forum to put FAQs or important information at the top, and of course any person you put as a committer on the plugin will have moderation access. People on the forum tag will see your custom header and links to the other resources attached to your plugin.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve tightened up the styling a bit on the forums and plugin pages, though still some cleanups to do there. Some older improvements you might have missed, but are still useful for users and developers alike:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Plugin headers&#8221; or those cool graphics you see at the top of plugin pages have really taken off, there are over 1,600 active now.</li>\n<li>You can now subscribe to get an email whenever a commit is made to a plugin repository even if it isn&#8217;t yours. There is no better way to follow the development of your favorite plugins.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love attending <a title="WordCamp Central" href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a> and local <a title="WordPress on Meetup.com" href="http://wordpress.meetup.com/">WordPress meetups</a> (which are awesome and you should try to attend if you are able), but at the core team meetup, the focus on working together and getting things done is unique, as is the experience of every person in the room being so highly qualified. This year, instead of just planning a core team meetup, I&#8217;m aiming a little higher and shooting for a full-on contributor/community summit.</p>\n<p>Core code isn&#8217;t the only way to contribute to the WordPress project. We have an active <a title="Theme Review Team blog" href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review team</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forum</a> volunteers, people writing <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page">documentation</a>, plugin managers, community event organizers, translators, and more. The teams have been siloed for too long, so we&#8217;ve recently begun the process of bringing them together by having teams elect representatives to facilitate more communication between the contributor groups. These reps will form the nucleus of the contributor summit now being planned for a long weekend at the end of October in Tybee Island, GA. This is completely different from a WordCamp. It will be a combination of co-working, unconference, and discussions among the project leaders, and participation will be by invitation.</p>\n<p>In addition to bringing together the active contributor team reps to work together, I think it&#8217;s important to include community members who don&#8217;t fall into that category (at least not yet!). Successful WordPress-based business, authors of popular plugins and themes, and people using WordPress in unexpected but intriguing ways should have a place at the table, too. That said, part of the magic of the core team meetup is the small size; it allows every voice not only to be heard, but to engage. Since this is my first attempt at bringing together so many groups and points of view, I want to try and keep it small enough to retain that personal atmosphere while at the same time ensuring that the best possible mix of people and businesses in the WordPress ecosystem is represented. This is where you come in!</p>\n<p>Taking a cue from events with limited availability like <a title="AdaCamp" href="http://dc.adacamp.org/">AdaCamp</a> (attendance) and the <a title="jQuery Conference" href="http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/">jQuery conference</a> (speaker roster), I want you to <a title="Nomination survey" href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations">nominate people and/or WordPress-based businesses to participate in the summit</a>. Yes, you can nominate yourself.* You can nominate up to 10 additional people &#8212; be prepared to provide URLs and the reason you think they should participate. You can also nominate up to 10 WordPress-based businesses without naming individual people, so if there&#8217;s a theme or hosting company (for example) that you think should be there, you don&#8217;t need to go looking for employee names. This nomination process will hopefully ensure that we don&#8217;t overlook someone who is making a difference in our community when it comes time to issue invitations.</p>\n<p>Nominations will be open for a week, after which <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations">the survey</a> will be closed and the process of analyzing the results** will begin. The nominations process will lead to invitations in June, confirmations in July, planning in August and September, and the summit itself in October. Hopefully we can stream and/or record some of the activity to share online at <a href="http://wordpress.tv">WordPress.tv</a>. Additional invitations may be extended up until the event if there are people/businesses that become more active in the community. If you&#8217;re thinking to yourself that maybe now&#8217;s the perfect time to start <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress">contributing time to the WordPress project</a>, good thinking! In the meantime, if you want to weigh in, <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations">fill in the community summit nomination form</a>. Thanks, and wish us luck!</p>\n<p><em>* Nominating yourself: Do nominate yourself if you fall into one of the categories described in the post above, or if you believe that you have a unique point of view. Please do not nominate yourself if you just think it would be cool to hang out with this group. This is a working event, and everyone is expected to bring something special to the table.</em></p>\n<p><em>** I (and/or a helpful community volunteer) will sift through the nominations and compile a shortlist of the most-nominated people/businesses and the most intriguing underdogs.

month, we asked, <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2012/07/19/how-often-do-you-blog/">how often do you blog?</a> The responses were spread out quite a bit, with 28% blogging 1 to 3 times a month, 26% blogging every day, 24% blogging 1 to 3 times a week, 13% blogging 4 to 6 times a week, and 8% blogging less than once a month.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m quite surprised to see the near tie between 1 to 3 times a month and every day, two frequencies which a quite different indeed. Rest-assured, most of you are blogging more than once a week, which is great news! You should enjoy blogging, and nothing says &#8220;I enjoy Blogging!&#8221; more than cranking out a few posts every week. Blogging shouldn&#8217;t be so difficult that you put it off. If you do, you&#8217;re doing it wrong. Try to find some little things to share, like a video you enjoyed watching or an article you enjoyed reading. The more you blog, the better you&#8217;ll get, and the more fun you&#8217;ll have.</p>\n<p>So, if you didn&#8217;t have a chance to tell us before, how often do you blog?</p>\n<img

or both. In the final tally after a month-long run, 45% of you blogged for both, 39% for Personal, and only 16% for Business.</p>\n<p>Putting those three reasons aside, one trend did emerge in the comments. Most of you blog because it&#8217;s fun. Sure, some of you blog for business and rarely have time for personal blogging, but it&#8217;s still fun, and that&#8217;s just great because if you consider blogging to be a chore, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.

years ago I posted about &#8220;<a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2010/07/a-new-focus/">A New Focus</a>&#8220;, where my time at Automattic adjusted to be centered on Akismet.  Back then Akismet was catching <strong>500,000,000</strong> spam comments per month (see the sidebar chart at <a href="http://akismet.com/about/">http://akismet.com/about/</a>).  Today it is catching just over <strong>2,000,000,000</strong> spam comments per month (with a peak of nearly <strong>2,500,000,000</strong> at the end of 2011).  Even with all that growth Akismet has continued to perform well, maintaining a high level of accuracy and performance, something that has been great to be a small part of.</p>\n<p>This summer I&#8217;ve been asked to shift my focus again, by joining the <a href="http://vaultpress.com/">VaultPress</a> team.</p>\n<p><a href="http://vaultpress.com/"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SkboV9fXhuE/UDBTqUa4NJI/AAAAAAAAAbg/t8O-UxilJqE/s381/vaultpress-logo-home.png" /></a></p>\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with VaultPress here is the elevator pitch: &#8220;VaultPress syncs the data from your WordPress site (posts, pages, comments, plugin &#038; theme files, and media uploads) as they are added.  On top of that VaultPress will scan your files for code vulnerabilities and changes to core WordPress files.&#8221; (more details are on the <a href="http://vaultpress.com/help/get-to-know/">Get to know VaultPress</a> page)</p>\n<p>VaultPress also provides a restore process.  If your WordPress site gets vaporized for some reason doing a fresh install and activating the VaultPress plugin will allow VaultPress.com to push a backup snapshot back to your server.  There is also an option to manually download a backup snapshot, if you just want to pull out something specific.</p>\n<p>The last two years focused on Akismet have been great, and now it is exciting to be taking on the new challenge of helping VaultPress improve and grow.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 16:35:54

(16, 1, '2012-07-20 10:57:52', '2012-07-20 10:57:52', 'Here are several of the most frequently asked questions about giving to the Foundation or the Home. Have another question not covered here? Just pick up the phone and call us, toll-free, at 1-800-277-4643. We welcome your questions..we''re happy to help!!!!\r\n\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Why should I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nFor a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Not only are you performing a Masonic duty in providing for the relief of worthy, distressed Master Masons and their families, you are assisting in maintaining a tradition of care, concern and compassion which has existed in Franklin for nearly 90 years and has served more than 7,000 adult residents and presently has over 480 residents.\r\n\r\n2. Including charitable giving in your estate or other financial planning may provide significant tax benefits, potentially greatly reducing your tax liability to the government and still enabling you to provide for family and friends as well as your charitable interests.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How may I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nGifts may be made directly to the Foundation in several ways. Outright gifts may be made by check or credit card (Visa or MasterCard). An outright gift of appreciated stock or other assets is also possible, potentially saving the donor capital gains taxes and possibly offering other tax advantages. As indicated above, a number of attractive charitable giving vehicles, which also offer tax advantages, are available to provide a "planned gift" at a later date. All gifts to the Foundation are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.\r\n\r\nGifts via check may also be made through your lodge Secretary.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What are the "charitable giving vehicles"?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nProbably the best known is the simple bequest provided in a Will which conveys a specific item, amount or percentage of an estate to the Foundation.\r\n\r\nOthers include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Charitable Gift Annuities;</li>\r\n	<li>Charitable Remainder Trusts; and</li>\r\n	<li>Charitable Lead Trusts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nGifts of life insurance, retirement plans and other assets may also be made.\r\n\r\nEach of these plans offers specific tax benefits which may vary with the donor''s circumstances; several offer an income stream to the donor and/or another individual. All of these "planned gifts" should be made with the assistance of the donor''s financial and or legal advisor(s). The Foundation staff is pleased to provide additional information about any or all of these vehicles and stands ready to be of assistance in the planning of such gifts.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>May I restrict a gift to a particular program or purpose?\r\n</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nYes, you may by specifying it for the program/purpose of your choice via a notation in the memo field of the check or in an accompanying letter. The Foundation has a form available upon request to assist donors in directing their gifts to a specific destination. As indicated above, a number of programs are available for your participation or support.\r\n\r\nGifts arriving without any specific target program or restriction are directed to an endowment fund.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How do I determine the charitable contribution amount for a gift of appreciated stock? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nFor stock regularly traded on a stock exchange, the charitable deduction is determined by using the average between the high and the low price on the date of the gift. For over-the-counter stock, use the average between the closing bid and asked prices on the date of the gift.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How can I deliver the stock to you? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nThere are three commonly used methods:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>by hand</li>\r\n	<li>by mail</li>\r\n	<li>through a broker</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n1. When you deliver stock by hand, you can either endorse the back of the stock certificate (s) in our presence or sign a separate stock assignment form, which is often called a stock power. If you cannot or do not wish to deliver the stock to use by hand at our offices, we may be able to arrange a meeting with you at your home.\r\n\r\n2. If you are delivering stock by mail, we recommend that you send the stock certificate (s) and the signed stock power (s) in separate envelopes. We further recommend that the stock certificate (s) be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Please enclose a cover letter providing your name, address, and telephone number along with any designated purpose for which the gift is being made. We will need a separate stock power form for each certificate of stock; be sure to sign the stock powers (s) exactly as the name reads on the stock certificate. Do not fill in our name on the stock power. Stock power forms are available from us or from your banker or broker.\r\n\r\n3. If you are delivering stock to use through a broker, instruct your broker to hold the stock for our account; do not instruct your broker to sell the stock, either in your name or in our name. Your broker should immediately give us a call for further instructions. If you have a questions about any of these three methods, please do not hesitate to give us a call.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What date controls for valuing a gift of stock?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nIt depends upon the method of delivery.\r\n\r\n(1) If the stock is delivered by hand, the date of physical delivery to us controls.\r\n\r\n(2) If the stock is mailed, the postmark date controls, assuming the stock certificate (s) and stock power (s) are received in due course.\r\n\r\n(3) If the stock is delivered through a broker, the date the broker transfers the stock into an account in our name is generally the date that controls.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>I am considering making a rather sizeable gift of appreciated stock. May I utilize all of the charitable deductions this year? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nCharitable deductions for gifts of stock and other appreciated property may be utilized up to 30% of your adjusted gross income in the year of the gift. If you make a sizeable gift, you may have to carry over part of your deduction to succeeding years. To the extent necessary, you can use your adjusted gross income for the year is $100,000, up 10 $30,000 of long-term appreciated stock given to charitable institutions and organizations is deductible this year; any amount over $30,000 may be carried forward for up to five additional years.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Can I contribute stock in a closely held corporation?\r\n</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nYes and there can be significant tax advantages for making such a gift. We will assist you in the proper procedures to follow.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Can I contribute stock that has depreciated rather than appreciated, in value?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nIt would be more tax advantageous to sell the depreciated stock, thereby establishing a capital loss, and then contribute the cash proceeds to us.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>I have heard that I can actually increase my income by making a charitable gift of appreciated stock. How is that possible? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nIf you own stock which currently provides you with a low annual yield, maybe 2%-3% or less, a “life income” gift may be appropriate. You could transfer the stock to us and establish a trust that would provide you with a 5% or greater annual return. This income would be paid to you and/or a loved one for life, after which the assets would be distributed outright to us. Through such an arrangement, you would be increasing your income and making a meaningful (and tax-deductible) contribution to us at the same time.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Did you know that the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation... </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Was founded in 1936 solely to provide financial assistance for the Indiana Masonic Home</li>\r\n	<li>Is a 501 © (3) not-for-profit corporation separate from the Indiana Masonic Home.</li>\r\n	<li>Is an endowment fund that provides a targeted distribution directly to the Indiana Masonic Home.</li>\r\n	<li>Has Provided the Indiana Masonic Home with over $30,000,000 since 1980.</li>\r\n	<li>Accepts both cash gifts and deferred gifts.</li>\r\n	<li>Has a Gold Card Sponsorship Program for donations of $100+</li>\r\n	<li>Donations are tax deductible up to 50% of your adjusted gross income.</li>\r\n	<li>Is honored if we are designated as a beneficiary in your will.</li>\r\n	<li>Can also be named as a beneficiary to an insurance policy.</li>\r\n	<li>Has contributor clubs at levels of $500, $1000, $2,500 &amp; $5,000+</li>\r\n	<li>Has several life income plans, e.g., Charitable Gift Annuities and Charitable Remainder Trusts</li>\r\n	<li>Accepts gives of Real Estate and Marketable Securities.</li>\r\n	<li>Representatives can visit your home to discuss various forms of giving.</li>\r\n	<li>Programs are presented regularly at local lodges.</li>\r\n	<li>Can be reached by calling 1-800-277-4643 for more information.</li>\r\n	<li>Email - IMHFoundation@aol.com " Web page www.IMHF.org</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nA not-for-profit corporation founded in 1936 to solely provide financial assistance in support of The Indiana Masonic Home.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is the responsibility of the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nTo provide maximum support for The Indiana Masonic Home by directing growth activities and investment policy of its endowment fund.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is meant by an "Endowment" fund?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nGifts given to the Foundation are invested in our Trust account.

(20, 1, '2012-07-20 11:00:31', '2012-07-20 11:00:31', '<strong><span>Gift Of Cash</span></strong>\r\n<span>    Cash (curreny, check, money orders, or bank draft) is the most popular form of giving because of its simplicity. Donors appreciate the tax deduction that gifts of cash provide, reducing the actual cost of the gift. The preferred method to contribute a gift of cash is to write a check payable to the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation, Inc. Checks should be sent to the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation, P.O. Box 44210. Indianapolis Indiana 46244-0210. Marketable Securities</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Marketable Securities</span></strong>\r\n<span> Outright gifts also include marketable securities, which are listed on an exchange. There are three financial benefits to the giving of long-term appreciated securities:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>(1) No tax needs to be paid on the gain if the stock is transferred directly to the foundation.</li>\r\n	<li>(2) The Average fair market value of the securities on the date of the gift is deductible as an itemized charitable contribution for federal income tax.</li>\r\n	<li>(3) Gifts of stock qualify for the Indiana tax credit</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong><span>Real Estate</span></strong>\r\n<span> Certain tax advantages apply to gifts of long-term appreciated real estate. These gifts typically provided an immediate income tax deduction and avoidance of capital gains tax. Other advantages also may apply. Gifts of real estate are reviewed individually by Foundation staff prior to gift transaction.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Planned or Deferred Gift</span></strong>\r\n<span> Planned giving opportunities offer advantages to donors instructed in both current and long-term tax benefits. Planned gift enables you to make a commitment to support the Foundation in a manner and at a time that is best for you. Through a planned gift, many persons who had not expected to have the resources that they can be provided increased financial security for themselves and their loved ones.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Bequests</span></strong>\r\n<span> A gift by will either large or small, is an excellent way to perpetuate your support of the Foundation. The Foundation may be designated as a recipient or as a contingent beneficiary of the bequest. Proper designation is: The Indiana Masonic Home Foundation, Inc., 525 N. Illinois St., P.O. Box 44210, Indianapolis, IN 46244-0210</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Life Income Arrangments</span></strong>\r\n<span> Some planned gifts opportunities can greatly assist the foundation in meeting its needs and objectives while also production an income for you or your loved ones. These are life income gifts. All life income gifts allow charitable deductions on your income tax for the year in which the gift arrangements are made. Carryover rules apply for an additional five years.</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>(1) Charitable Gift Annuities: Our most popular gift! Establishing a charitable gift annuity with a contribution of cash or securities to the Foundation will provide you (or the person you designated with a fixed amount of guaranteed life-time annual income. The percentage of guaranteed income is based on your and/ or your spouses age. Charitable gift annuities offer a current income tax deduction as well as income which is largely tax-free during the life of the beneficiary(ies). If long term capital gain property or securities are donated, capital gain taxes are greatly reduced.</li>\r\n	<li>(2) Charitable Remainder Trusts: You may establish a charitable remainder trust to provide substantial income to you during your life, during the life of a named beneficiary, or both. Pay out rates are negotiated with the Foundation. After death(s) of the beneficiary(ies), the trust assists are transferred to the Foundation and are allocated for the purpose you designated.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong><span>Gifts of Life Insurance</span></strong>\r\n<span> When properly arranged, life insurance offers an attractive way to benefit the Foundation at a relatively low cost. Life insurance gifts permit you to provide a substantial deferred gift for younger brethren because of the relatively low premium expense. Also, the proceeds from the policy are paid promptly to the Foundation, and this eliminates the delays caused by the estate administration process. </span>\r\n<span> For Maximum tax benefits, gifts of life insurance should be discussed with the foundation staff before naming or renaming the Foundation as beneficiary.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Acknowledgment of Gifts</span></strong>\r\n<span>All gifts and commitments to the IMHF receive a written acknowledgement in accordance with IRS rules and regulations for charitable gifts to 501 (c) (3).</span>', 'Ways To Give', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'ways-to-give', '', '', '2012-08-15 01:43:41', '2012-08-15 01:43:41', '', 0, 'http://localhost/imhf/?page_id=20', 0, 'page', '', 0),

The net income from such trust will be paid annually to the Home to support its purposes and needs. The Foundation will provide trust services for funds which have been received and designated for special purpose of the Home."</em></span></p>\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Indiana Masonic Home Foundation (IMHF) was established in 1936 to further implement financial support of the Home. We are a separate corporation with a separate Board of Directors to oversee our operations and investments.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Further, the Foundation engages in promotional and public relation activities to increase the assets and properties held by the Foundation; communicates to the Masonic membership the charitable need, purpose, and benefits of the Indiana Masonic Home, and provides the necessary professional guidance to help Freemasonry be successful in its benevolent efforts. This is achieved through the joint effort of the Foundation, its staff and Directors, the Home and its staff, and all the brothers and sisters of the family of Freemasonry.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> It is important to know that the Foundation fund, gives only its net income or interest to the Home each year. Therefore, gifts to the Foundation have never been spent. Also, gifts are tax deductible as described in section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> Located on 300 magnificent acres, the Indiana Masonic Home is conveniently located in the friendly town of Franklin, just south of Indianapolis. Since its beginning in 1916, it has been a retirement community serving all Indiana Masonic families.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Whether you are a senior who is completely independent, one that seeks occasional assistance, or one that requires comprehensive health care, the Indiana Masonic Home campus is able to meet your needs. We offer a variety of living arrangements, and different levels of care depending on your needs. Make yourself at home in one of our cottages, duplexes, or one of the one, or two bedroom apartments. You no longer need to be concerned about the daily chores of cooking, housekeeping, laundry and yard work. The Medical Center provides one of the finest long term health care facilities in the Midwest. This 160 bed center provides comprehensive care and offers private and semi-private Quarters.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There are many activities for Masonic Home residents. On the grounds of the campus are Kresge Chapel and Ransford Chapel where Sunday services are conducted to accommodate many faiths and physical requirements of the residents. During the week you will have the opportunity to be active in exercise groups, prayer circle, coffee and social hours, crafts, ceramics, cards, concerts, outings and games. You will make many new friends. Day trips and shopping trips are also planned. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Not only will you find a new home and friends here, but you will be surrounded by beautiful campus acres. When entering our campus you will see the distinctive, impressive arch and view lovely manicured flowered gardens and the incredible elevated garden fountain. Also, on the campus are the Indiana Masonic Library and Museum, the Marvin Isley Bell Tower, a greenhouse, the Indiana Masonic Supplies gift shop, and offices of the Grand Chapter, O.E.S. and Indiana Demolay. </span>', 'About IMHF', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '4-revision-6', '', '', '2012-07-24 01:59:48', '2012-07-24 01:59:48', '', 4, 'http://localhost/imhf/4-revision-6/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(56, 1, '2012-07-25 02:46:25', '2012-07-25 02:46:25', 'Here are several of the most frequently asked questions about giving to the Foundation or the Home. Have another question not covered here? Just pick up the phone and call us, toll-free, at 1-800-277-4643. We welcome your questions..we''re happy to help!!!!\n\n[accordions]\n[accordion title="Why should I make a gift to the Foundation?" class="accordionButton"]\n\n[/accordion]\n[/accordions]\n\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Why should I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nFor a number of reasons:\n\n1. Not only are you performing a Masonic duty in providing for the relief of worthy, distressed Master Masons and their families, you are assisting in maintaining a tradition of care, concern and compassion which has existed in Franklin for nearly 90 years and has served more than 7,000 adult residents and presently has over 480 residents.\n\n2. Including charitable giving in your estate or other financial planning may provide significant tax benefits, potentially greatly reducing your tax liability to the government and still enabling you to provide for family and friends as well as your charitable interests.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How may I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nGifts may be made directly to the Foundation in several ways. Outright gifts may be made by check or credit card (Visa or MasterCard). An outright gift of appreciated stock or other assets is also possible, potentially saving the donor capital gains taxes and possibly offering other tax advantages. As indicated above, a number of attractive charitable giving vehicles, which also offer tax advantages, are available to provide a "planned gift" at a later date. All gifts to the Foundation are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.\n\nGifts via check may also be made through your lodge Secretary.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What are the "charitable giving vehicles"?</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nProbably the best known is the simple bequest provided in a Will which conveys a specific item, amount or percentage of an estate to the Foundation.\n\nOthers include:\n<ul>\n	<li>Charitable Gift Annuities;</li>\n	<li>Charitable Remainder Trusts; and</li>\n	<li>Charitable Lead Trusts.</li>\n</ul>\nGifts of life insurance, retirement plans and other assets may also be made.\n\nEach of these plans offers specific tax benefits which may vary with the donor''s circumstances; several offer an income stream to the donor and/or another individual. All of these "planned gifts" should be made with the assistance of the donor''s financial and or legal advisor(s). The Foundation staff is pleased to provide additional information about any or all of these vehicles and stands ready to be of assistance in the planning of such gifts.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>May I restrict a gift to a particular program or purpose?\n</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nYes, you may by specifying it for the program/purpose of your choice via a notation in the memo field of the check or in an accompanying letter. The Foundation has a form available upon request to assist donors in directing their gifts to a specific destination. As indicated above, a number of programs are available for your participation or support.\n\nGifts arriving without any specific target program or restriction are directed to an endowment fund.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How do I determine the charitable contribution amount for a gift of appreciated stock? </strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nFor stock regularly traded on a stock exchange, the charitable deduction is determined by using the average between the high and the low price on the date of the gift. For over-the-counter stock, use the average between the closing bid and asked prices on the date of the gift.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How can I deliver the stock to you? </strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nThere are three commonly used methods:\n<ol>\n	<li>by hand</li>\n	<li>by mail</li>\n	<li>through a broker</li>\n</ol>\n1. When you deliver stock by hand, you can either endorse the back of the stock certificate (s) in our presence or sign a separate stock assignment form, which is often called a stock power. If you cannot or do not wish to deliver the stock to use by hand at our offices, we may be able to arrange a meeting with you at your home.\n\n2. If you are delivering stock by mail, we recommend that you send the stock certificate (s) and the signed stock power (s) in separate envelopes. We further recommend that the stock certificate (s) be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Please enclose a cover letter providing your name, address, and telephone number along with any designated purpose for which the gift is being made. We will need a separate stock power form for each certificate of stock; be sure to sign the stock powers (s) exactly as the name reads on the stock certificate. Do not fill in our name on the stock power. Stock power forms are available from us or from your banker or broker.\n\n3. If you are delivering stock to use through a broker, instruct your broker to hold the stock for our account; do not instruct your broker to sell the stock, either in your name or in our name. Your broker should immediately give us a call for further instructions. If you have a questions about any of these three methods, please do not hesitate to give us a call.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What date controls for valuing a gift of stock?</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nIt depends upon the method of delivery.\n\n(1) If the stock is delivered by hand, the date of physical delivery to us controls.\n\n(2) If the stock is mailed, the postmark date controls, assuming the stock certificate (s) and stock power (s) are received in due course.\n\n(3) If the stock is delivered through a broker, the date the broker transfers the stock into an account in our name is generally the date that controls.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>I am considering making a rather sizeable gift of appreciated stock. May I utilize all of the charitable deductions this year? </strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nCharitable deductions for gifts of stock and other appreciated property may be utilized up to 30% of your adjusted gross income in the year of the gift. If you make a sizeable gift, you may have to carry over part of your deduction to succeeding years. To the extent necessary, you can use your adjusted gross income for the year is $100,000, up 10 $30,000 of long-term appreciated stock given to charitable institutions and organizations is deductible this year; any amount over $30,000 may be carried forward for up to five additional years.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Can I contribute stock in a closely held corporation?\n</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nYes and there can be significant tax advantages for making such a gift. We will assist you in the proper procedures to follow.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Can I contribute stock that has depreciated rather than appreciated, in value?</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nIt would be more tax advantageous to sell the depreciated stock, thereby establishing a capital loss, and then contribute the cash proceeds to us.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>I have heard that I can actually increase my income by making a charitable gift of appreciated stock. How is that possible? </strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nIf you own stock which currently provides you with a low annual yield, maybe 2%-3% or less, a “life income” gift may be appropriate. You could transfer the stock to us and establish a trust that would provide you with a 5% or greater annual return. This income would be paid to you and/or a loved one for life, after which the assets would be distributed outright to us. Through such an arrangement, you would be increasing your income and making a meaningful (and tax-deductible) contribution to us at the same time.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Did you know that the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation... </strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n<ul>\n	<li>Was founded in 1936 solely to provide financial assistance for the Indiana Masonic Home</li>\n	<li>Is a 501 © (3) not-for-profit corporation separate from the Indiana Masonic Home.</li>\n	<li>Is an endowment fund that provides a targeted distribution directly to the Indiana Masonic Home.</li>\n	<li>Has Provided the Indiana Masonic Home with over $30,000,000 since 1980.</li>\n	<li>Accepts both cash gifts and deferred gifts.</li>\n	<li>Has a Gold Card Sponsorship Program for donations of $100+</li>\n	<li>Donations are tax deductible up to 50% of your adjusted gross income.</li>\n	<li>Is honored if we are designated as a beneficiary in your will.</li>\n	<li>Can also be named as a beneficiary to an insurance policy.</li>\n	<li>Has contributor clubs at levels of $500, $1000, $2,500 &amp; $5,000+</li>\n	<li>Has several life income plans, e.g., Charitable Gift Annuities and Charitable Remainder Trusts</li>\n	<li>Accepts gives of Real Estate and Marketable Securities.</li>\n	<li>Representatives can visit your home to discuss various forms of giving.</li>\n	<li>Programs are presented regularly at local lodges.</li>\n	<li>Can be reached by calling 1-800-277-4643 for more information.</li>\n	<li>Email - IMHFoundation@aol.com " Web page www.IMHF.org</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation?</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nA not-for-profit corporation founded in 1936 to solely provide financial assistance in support of The Indiana Masonic Home.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is the responsibility of the Foundation?</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nTo provide maximum support for The Indiana Masonic Home by directing growth activities and investment policy of its endowment fund.\n\n</div>\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is meant by an "Endowment" fund?</strong></p>\n\n<div class="accordionContent">\n\nGifts given to the Foundation are invested in our Trust account.

Not only are you performing a Masonic duty in providing for the relief of worthy, distressed Master Masons and their families, you are assisting in maintaining a tradition of care, concern and compassion which has existed in Franklin for nearly 90 years and has served more than 7,000 adult residents and presently has over 480 residents.\r\n\r\n2. Including charitable giving in your estate or other financial planning may provide significant tax benefits, potentially greatly reducing your tax liability to the government and still enabling you to provide for family and friends as well as your charitable interests.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How may I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Gifts may be made directly to the Foundation in several ways. Outright gifts may be made by check or credit card (Visa or MasterCard). An outright gift of appreciated stock or other assets is also possible, potentially saving the donor capital gains taxes and possibly offering other tax advantages. As indicated above, a number of attractive charitable giving vehicles, which also offer tax advantages, are available to provide a "planned gift" at a later date.

Just pick up the phone and call us, toll-free, at 1-800-277-4643. We welcome your questions..we''re happy to help!!!!\r\n\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Why should I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nFor a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Not only are you performing a Masonic duty in providing for the relief of worthy, distressed Master Masons and their families, you are assisting in maintaining a tradition of care, concern and compassion which has existed in Franklin for nearly 90 years and has served more than 7,000 adult residents and presently has over 480 residents.\r\n\r\n2. Including charitable giving in your estate or other financial planning may provide significant tax benefits, potentially greatly reducing your tax liability to the government and still enabling you to provide for family and friends as well as your charitable interests.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How may I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Gifts may be made directly to the Foundation in several ways. Outright gifts may be made by check or credit card (Visa or MasterCard). An outright gift of appreciated stock or other assets is also possible, potentially saving the donor capital gains taxes and possibly offering other tax advantages. As indicated above, a number of attractive charitable giving vehicles, which also offer tax advantages, are available to provide a "planned gift" at a later date. All gifts to the Foundation are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.</p>\r\n\r\nGifts via check may also be made through your lodge Secretary.\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What are the "charitable giving vehicles"?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Probably the best known is the simple bequest provided in a Will which conveys a specific item, amount or percentage of an estate to the Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others include: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Charitable Gift Annuities;</li><li>Charitable Remainder Trusts; and</li><li>Charitable Lead Trusts.</li></ul>\r\n<p>Gifts of life insurance, retirement plans and other assets may also be made.</p>\r\nEach of these plans offers specific tax benefits which may vary with the donor''s circumstances; several offer an income stream to the donor and/or another individual. All of these "planned gifts" should be made with the assistance of the donor''s financial and or legal advisor(s). The Foundation staff is pleased to provide additional information about any or all of these vehicles and stands ready to be of assistance in the planning of such gifts.\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>May I restrict a gift to a particular program or purpose?\r\n</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Yes, you may by specifying it for the program/purpose of your choice via a notation in the memo field of the check or in an accompanying letter. The Foundation has a form available upon request to assist donors in directing their gifts to a specific destination. As indicated above, a number of programs are available for your participation or support.</p>\r\n\r\nGifts arriving without any specific target program or restriction are directed to an endowment fund.\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How do I determine the charitable contribution amount for a gift of appreciated stock? </strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>For stock regularly traded on a stock exchange, the charitable deduction is determined by using the average between the high and the low price on the date of the gift. For over-the-counter stock, use the average between the closing bid and asked prices on the date of the gift.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How can I deliver the stock to you? </strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>There are three commonly used methods:</p>\r\n<ol><li>by hand</li><li>by mail</li><li>through a broker</li></ol>\r\n<p>1. When you deliver stock by hand, you can either endorse the back of the stock certificate (s) in our presence or sign a separate stock assignment form, which is often called a stock power. If you cannot or do not wish to deliver the stock to use by hand at our offices, we may be able to arrange a meeting with you at your home.</p>\r\n<p>2. If you are delivering stock by mail, we recommend that you send the stock certificate (s) and the signed stock power (s) in separate envelopes. We further recommend that the stock certificate (s) be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Please enclose a cover letter providing your name, address, and telephone number along with any designated purpose for which the gift is being made. We will need a separate stock power form for each certificate of stock; be sure to sign the stock powers (s) exactly as the name reads on the stock certificate. Do not fill in our name on the stock power. Stock power forms are available from us or from your banker or broker. </p>\r\n3. If you are delivering stock to use through a broker, instruct your broker to hold the stock for our account; do not instruct your broker to sell the stock, either in your name or in our name. Your broker should immediately give us a call for further instructions. If you have a questions about any of these three methods, please do not hesitate to give us a call. \r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What date controls for valuing a gift of stock?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>It depends upon the method of delivery.</p>\r\n<p>(1) If the stock is delivered by hand, the date of physical delivery to us controls.</p>\r\n<p>(2) If the stock is mailed, the postmark date controls, assuming the stock certificate (s) and stock power (s) are received in due course. </p>\r\n<p>(3) If the stock is delivered through a broker, the date the broker transfers the stock into an account in our name is generally the date that controls.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>I am considering making a rather sizeable gift of appreciated stock. May I utilize all of the charitable deductions this year? </strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Charitable deductions for gifts of stock and other appreciated property may be utilized up to 30% of your adjusted gross income in the year of the gift. If you make a sizeable gift, you may have to carry over part of your deduction to succeeding years. To the extent necessary, you can use your adjusted gross income for the year is $100,000, up 10 $30,000 of long-term appreciated stock given to charitable institutions and organizations is deductible this year; any amount over $30,000 may be carried forward for up to five additional years.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Can I contribute stock in a closely held corporation?\r\n</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Yes and there can be significant tax advantages for making such a gift.

How is that possible? </strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>\r\nIf you own stock which currently provides you with a low annual yield, maybe 2%-3% or less, a “life income” gift may be appropriate. You could transfer the stock to us and establish a trust that would provide you with a 5% or greater annual return. This income would be paid to you and/or a loved one for life, after which the assets would be distributed outright to us.

(124, 1, '2012-07-24 06:38:47', '2012-07-24 06:38:47', 'Here are several of the most frequently asked questions about giving to the Foundation or the Home. Have another question not covered here? Just pick up the phone and call us, toll-free, at 1-800-277-4643. We welcome your questions..we''re happy to help!!!!\r\n\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Why should I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nFor a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Not only are you performing a Masonic duty in providing for the relief of worthy, distressed Master Masons and their families, you are assisting in maintaining a tradition of care, concern and compassion which has existed in Franklin for nearly 90 years and has served more than 7,000 adult residents and presently has over 480 residents.\r\n\r\n2. Including charitable giving in your estate or other financial planning may provide significant tax benefits, potentially greatly reducing your tax liability to the government and still enabling you to provide for family and friends as well as your charitable interests.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How may I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Gifts may be made directly to the Foundation in several ways. Outright gifts may be made by check or credit card (Visa or MasterCard). An outright gift of appreciated stock or other assets is also possible, potentially saving the donor capital gains taxes and possibly offering other tax advantages. As indicated above, a number of attractive charitable giving vehicles, which also offer tax advantages, are available to provide a "planned gift" at a later date.

All of these "planned gifts" should be made with the assistance of the donor''s financial and or legal advisor(s). The Foundation staff is pleased to provide additional information about any or all of these vehicles and stands ready to be of assistance in the planning of such gifts.\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>May I restrict a gift to a particular program or purpose?\r\n</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Yes, you may by specifying it for the program/purpose of your choice via a notation in the memo field of the check or in an accompanying letter.

As indicated above, a number of programs are available for your participation or support.</p>\r\n\r\nGifts arriving without any specific target program or restriction are directed to an endowment fund.\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How do I determine the charitable contribution amount for a gift of appreciated stock? </strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>For stock regularly traded on a stock exchange, the charitable deduction is determined by using the average between the high and the low price on the date of the gift. For over-the-counter stock, use the average between the closing bid and asked prices on the date of the gift.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How can I deliver the stock to you? </strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>There are three commonly used methods:</p>\r\n<ol><li>by hand</li><li>by mail</li><li>through a broker</li></ol>\r\n<p>1. When you deliver stock by hand, you can either endorse the back of the stock certificate (s) in our presence or sign a separate stock assignment form, which is often called a stock power. If you cannot or do not wish to deliver the stock to use by hand at our offices, we may be able to arrange a meeting with you at your home.</p>\r\n<p>2. If you are delivering stock by mail, we recommend that you send the stock certificate (s) and the signed stock power (s) in separate envelopes. We further recommend that the stock certificate (s) be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Please enclose a cover letter providing your name, address, and telephone number along with any designated purpose for which the gift is being made. We will need a separate stock power form for each certificate of stock; be sure to sign the stock powers (s) exactly as the name reads on the stock certificate. Do not fill in our name on the stock power. Stock power forms are available from us or from your banker or broker. </p>\r\n3. If you are delivering stock to use through a broker, instruct your broker to hold the stock for our account; do not instruct your broker to sell the stock, either in your name or in our name. Your broker should immediately give us a call for further instructions. If you have a questions about any of these three methods, please do not hesitate to give us a call. \r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What date controls for valuing a gift of stock?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>It depends upon the method of delivery.</p>\r\n<p>(1) If the stock is delivered by hand, the date of physical delivery to us controls.</p>\r\n<p>(2) If the stock is mailed, the postmark date controls, assuming the stock certificate (s) and stock power (s) are received in due course. </p>\r\n<p>(3) If the stock is delivered through a broker, the date the broker transfers the stock into an account in our name is generally the date that controls.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>I am considering making a rather sizeable gift of appreciated stock. May I utilize all of the charitable deductions this year? </strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Charitable deductions for gifts of stock and other appreciated property may be utilized up to 30% of your adjusted gross income in the year of the gift. If you make a sizeable gift, you may have to carry over part of your deduction to succeeding years. To the extent necessary, you can use your adjusted gross income for the year is $100,000, up 10 $30,000 of long-term appreciated stock given to charitable institutions and organizations is deductible this year; any amount over $30,000 may be carried forward for up to five additional years.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Can I contribute stock in a closely held corporation?\r\n</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Yes and there can be significant tax advantages for making such a gift. We will assist you in the proper procedures to follow.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Can I contribute stock that has depreciated rather than appreciated, in value?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>It would be more tax advantageous to sell the depreciated stock, thereby establishing a capital loss, and then contribute the cash proceeds to us. </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>I have heard that I can actually increase my income by making a charitable gift of appreciated stock. How is that possible? </strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>\r\nIf you own stock which currently provides you with a low annual yield, maybe 2%-3% or less, a “life income” gift may be appropriate. You could transfer the stock to us and establish a trust that would provide you with a 5% or greater annual return. This income would be paid to you and/or a loved one for life, after which the assets would be distributed outright to us. Through such an arrangement, you would be increasing your income and making a meaningful (and tax-deductible) contribution to us at the same time. </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Did you know that the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation... </strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<ul><li>Was founded in 1936 solely to provide financial assistance for the Indiana Masonic Home </li><li>Is a 501 &copy; (3) not-for-profit corporation separate from the Indiana Masonic Home.</li><li>Is an endowment fund that provides a targeted distribution directly to the Indiana Masonic Home. </li><li>Has Provided the Indiana Masonic Home with over $30,000,000 since 1980. </li><li>Accepts both cash gifts and deferred gifts. </li><li>Has a Gold Card Sponsorship Program for donations of $100+ </li><li>Donations are tax deductible up to 50% of your adjusted gross income. </li><li>Is honored if we are designated as a beneficiary in your will.</li><li>Can also be named as a beneficiary to an insurance policy.</li><li>Has contributor clubs at levels of $500, $1000, $2,500 & $5,000+ </li><li>Has several life income plans, e.g., Charitable Gift Annuities and Charitable Remainder Trusts</li><li>Accepts gives of Real Estate and Marketable Securities.</li><li>Representatives can visit your home to discuss various forms of giving. </li><li>Programs are presented regularly at local lodges. </li><li>Can be reached by calling 1-800-277-4643 for more information.</li><li>Email - IMHFoundation@aol.com " Web page www.IMHF.org </li></ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>A not-for-profit corporation founded in 1936 to solely provide financial assistance in support of The Indiana Masonic Home. </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is the responsibility of the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>To provide maximum support for The Indiana Masonic Home by directing growth activities and investment policy of its endowment fund.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is meant by an "Endowment" fund?</strong></p>\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<p>Gifts given to the Foundation are invested in our Trust account.

Including charitable giving in your estate or other financial planning may provide significant tax benefits, potentially greatly reducing your tax liability to the government and still enabling you to provide for family and friends as well as your charitable interests.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How may I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nGifts may be made directly to the Foundation in several ways.

Just pick up the phone and call us, toll-free, at 1-800-277-4643. We welcome your questions..we''re happy to help!!!!\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Why should I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nFor a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Not only are you performing a Masonic duty in providing for the relief of worthy, distressed Master Masons and their families, you are assisting in maintaining a tradition of care, concern and compassion which has existed in Franklin for nearly 90 years and has served more than 7,000 adult residents and presently has over 480 residents.\r\n\r\n2. Including charitable giving in your estate or other financial planning may provide significant tax benefits, potentially greatly reducing your tax liability to the government and still enabling you to provide for family and friends as well as your charitable interests.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How may I make a gift to the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nGifts may be made directly to the Foundation in several ways. Outright gifts may be made by check or credit card (Visa or MasterCard). An outright gift of appreciated stock or other assets is also possible, potentially saving the donor capital gains taxes and possibly offering other tax advantages. As indicated above, a number of attractive charitable giving vehicles, which also offer tax advantages, are available to provide a "planned gift" at a later date. All gifts to the Foundation are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.\r\n\r\nGifts via check may also be made through your lodge Secretary.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What are the "charitable giving vehicles"?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nProbably the best known is the simple bequest provided in a Will which conveys a specific item, amount or percentage of an estate to the Foundation.\r\n\r\nOthers include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Charitable Gift Annuities;</li>\r\n	<li>Charitable Remainder Trusts; and</li>\r\n	<li>Charitable Lead Trusts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nGifts of life insurance, retirement plans and other assets may also be made.\r\n\r\nEach of these plans offers specific tax benefits which may vary with the donor''s circumstances; several offer an income stream to the donor and/or another individual. All of these "planned gifts" should be made with the assistance of the donor''s financial and or legal advisor(s). The Foundation staff is pleased to provide additional information about any or all of these vehicles and stands ready to be of assistance in the planning of such gifts.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>May I restrict a gift to a particular program or purpose?\r\n</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nYes, you may by specifying it for the program/purpose of your choice via a notation in the memo field of the check or in an accompanying letter. The Foundation has a form available upon request to assist donors in directing their gifts to a specific destination. As indicated above, a number of programs are available for your participation or support.\r\n\r\nGifts arriving without any specific target program or restriction are directed to an endowment fund.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How do I determine the charitable contribution amount for a gift of appreciated stock? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nFor stock regularly traded on a stock exchange, the charitable deduction is determined by using the average between the high and the low price on the date of the gift. For over-the-counter stock, use the average between the closing bid and asked prices on the date of the gift.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>How can I deliver the stock to you? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nThere are three commonly used methods:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>by hand</li>\r\n	<li>by mail</li>\r\n	<li>through a broker</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n1. When you deliver stock by hand, you can either endorse the back of the stock certificate (s) in our presence or sign a separate stock assignment form, which is often called a stock power. If you cannot or do not wish to deliver the stock to use by hand at our offices, we may be able to arrange a meeting with you at your home.\r\n\r\n2. If you are delivering stock by mail, we recommend that you send the stock certificate (s) and the signed stock power (s) in separate envelopes. We further recommend that the stock certificate (s) be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Please enclose a cover letter providing your name, address, and telephone number along with any designated purpose for which the gift is being made. We will need a separate stock power form for each certificate of stock; be sure to sign the stock powers (s) exactly as the name reads on the stock certificate. Do not fill in our name on the stock power. Stock power forms are available from us or from your banker or broker.\r\n\r\n3. If you are delivering stock to use through a broker, instruct your broker to hold the stock for our account; do not instruct your broker to sell the stock, either in your name or in our name. Your broker should immediately give us a call for further instructions. If you have a questions about any of these three methods, please do not hesitate to give us a call.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What date controls for valuing a gift of stock?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nIt depends upon the method of delivery.\r\n\r\n(1) If the stock is delivered by hand, the date of physical delivery to us controls.\r\n\r\n(2) If the stock is mailed, the postmark date controls, assuming the stock certificate (s) and stock power (s) are received in due course.\r\n\r\n(3) If the stock is delivered through a broker, the date the broker transfers the stock into an account in our name is generally the date that controls.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>I am considering making a rather sizeable gift of appreciated stock. May I utilize all of the charitable deductions this year? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nCharitable deductions for gifts of stock and other appreciated property may be utilized up to 30% of your adjusted gross income in the year of the gift. If you make a sizeable gift, you may have to carry over part of your deduction to succeeding years. To the extent necessary, you can use your adjusted gross income for the year is $100,000, up 10 $30,000 of long-term appreciated stock given to charitable institutions and organizations is deductible this year; any amount over $30,000 may be carried forward for up to five additional years.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Can I contribute stock in a closely held corporation?\r\n</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nYes and there can be significant tax advantages for making such a gift. We will assist you in the proper procedures to follow.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Can I contribute stock that has depreciated rather than appreciated, in value?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nIt would be more tax advantageous to sell the depreciated stock, thereby establishing a capital loss, and then contribute the cash proceeds to us.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>I have heard that I can actually increase my income by making a charitable gift of appreciated stock. How is that possible? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nIf you own stock which currently provides you with a low annual yield, maybe 2%-3% or less, a “life income” gift may be appropriate. You could transfer the stock to us and establish a trust that would provide you with a 5% or greater annual return. This income would be paid to you and/or a loved one for life, after which the assets would be distributed outright to us. Through such an arrangement, you would be increasing your income and making a meaningful (and tax-deductible) contribution to us at the same time.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>Did you know that the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation... </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Was founded in 1936 solely to provide financial assistance for the Indiana Masonic Home</li>\r\n	<li>Is a 501 © (3) not-for-profit corporation separate from the Indiana Masonic Home.</li>\r\n	<li>Is an endowment fund that provides a targeted distribution directly to the Indiana Masonic Home.</li>\r\n	<li>Has Provided the Indiana Masonic Home with over $30,000,000 since 1980.</li>\r\n	<li>Accepts both cash gifts and deferred gifts.</li>\r\n	<li>Has a Gold Card Sponsorship Program for donations of $100+</li>\r\n	<li>Donations are tax deductible up to 50% of your adjusted gross income.</li>\r\n	<li>Is honored if we are designated as a beneficiary in your will.</li>\r\n	<li>Can also be named as a beneficiary to an insurance policy.</li>\r\n	<li>Has contributor clubs at levels of $500, $1000, $2,500 &amp; $5,000+</li>\r\n	<li>Has several life income plans, e.g., Charitable Gift Annuities and Charitable Remainder Trusts</li>\r\n	<li>Accepts gives of Real Estate and Marketable Securities.</li>\r\n	<li>Representatives can visit your home to discuss various forms of giving.</li>\r\n	<li>Programs are presented regularly at local lodges.</li>\r\n	<li>Can be reached by calling 1-800-277-4643 for more information.</li>\r\n	<li>Email - IMHFoundation@aol.com " Web page www.IMHF.org</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nA not-for-profit corporation founded in 1936 to solely provide financial assistance in support of The Indiana Masonic Home.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is the responsibility of the Foundation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nTo provide maximum support for The Indiana Masonic Home by directing growth activities and investment policy of its endowment fund.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class="accordionButton"><strong>What is meant by an "Endowment" fund?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class="accordionContent">\r\n\r\nGifts given to the Foundation are invested in our Trust account.

Donors appreciate the tax deduction that gifts of cash provide, reducing the actual cost of the gift. The preferred method to contribute a gift of cash is to write a check payable to the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation, Inc. Checks should be sent to the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation, P.O. Box 44210. Indianapolis Indiana 46244-0210. Marketable Securities</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Marketable Securities</span></strong>\r\n<span>    Outright gifts also include marketable securities, which are listed on an exchange. There are three financial benefits to the giving of long-term appreciated securities:</span>\r\n<ol><li>(1) No tax needs to be paid on the gain if the stock is transferred directly to the foundation.</li><li>(2) The Average fair market value of the securities on the date of the gift is deductible as an itemized charitable contribution for federal income tax.</li><li>(3) Gifts of stock qualify for the Indiana tax credit</li></ol>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Real Estate</span></strong>\r\n<span>    Certain tax advantages apply to gifts of long-term appreciated real estate. These gifts typically provided an immediate income tax deduction and avoidance of capital gains tax. Other advantages also may apply. Gifts of real estate are reviewed individually by Foundation staff prior to gift transaction.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Planned or Deferred Gift</span></strong>\r\n<span>    Planned giving opportunities offer advantages to donors instructed in both current and long-term tax benefits. Planned gift enables you to make a commitment to support the Foundation in a manner and at a time that is best for you. Through a planned gift, many persons who had not expected to have the resources that they can be provided increased financial security for themselves and their loved ones.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Bequests</span></strong>\r\n<span>    A gift by will either large or small, is an excellent way to perpetuate your support of the Foundation. The Foundation may be designated as a recipient or as a contingent beneficiary of the bequest. Proper designation is: The Indiana Masonic Home Foundation, Inc., 525 N. Illinois St., P.O. Box 44210, Indianapolis, IN 46244-0210</span>\r\n\r\n<strong><span>Life Income Arrangments</span></strong>\r\n<span>    Some planned gifts opportunities can greatly assist the foundation in meeting its needs and objectives while also production an income for you or your loved ones. These are life income gifts. All life income gifts allow charitable deductions on your income tax for the year in which the gift arrangements are made. Carryover rules apply for an additional five years.</span><ol><li>(1) Charitable Gift Annuities: Our most popular gift! Establishing a charitable gift annuity with a contribution of cash or securities to the Foundation will provide you (or the person you designated with a fixed amount of guaranteed life-time annual income. The percentage of guaranteed income is based on your and/ or your spouses age. Charitable gift annuities offer a current income tax deduction as well as income which is largely tax-free during the life of the beneficiary(ies).
