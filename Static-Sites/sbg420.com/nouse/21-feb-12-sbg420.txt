• HOME PAGE
the scrolling gallery.
please remove the first picture..it was their front view of the shop..

just that picture and we're good to roll.


• FAQ PAGE
can we move the FAQ starting link a lil bit on top? currently it leaves big gap between logo and info.

• please put splash page, client mention that it was included in the package that's why she paid $300 for the promo site.

Check this link: http://www.sbg420.com/

it should be like that..you may want to improvise to get the theme we use.



Thanks =)
