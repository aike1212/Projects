			Q. How should I clean my pipe?<br />
			<strong>A. Well first DO NOT BOIL your pipe. That weakens the glass. We recommend either Bling, or 420 Cleaner... It is the best by far. If you are on a budget you can get rubbing alcohol and Epsom salts... Mix say a cup or so of alcohol with a few tablespoons of Epsom salts... then cover holes fill piece about half way and Shake it.</strong>
