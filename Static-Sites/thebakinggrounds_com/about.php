	<h1>About Us</h1>
	
	<p>
		We have been baking and decorating cakes for about twenty-five years. My father had a large full line
		bakery in the north for over forty five years. We all worked with him and also had our own full line 
		bakery for several years. We have a wonderful cake studio, and are primarily concentrating on wedding
		and groom cakes. This is truly a family business, as we have my wife and I as owners, Tiffany our oldest
		is a great baker, our daughter Caley who is an expert cake decorator, Lexi our 3rd, is also a fantastic
		decorator. Summer, our youngest daughter helps wherever she can. Angel Rose, Chloe Autumn, Aubry Love,
		and Addie Jean are our beautiful granddaughters, and come around to "sample" the goodies! As you can see,
		we are blessed! We have the moistest wedding cakes and freshest products to be found. Your cake is baked
		fresh for your event, not frozen for months on end. We are certain that if you try our cakes, you will buy
		them. Brides &amp; Grooms (or anyone!) should not sacrifice on the taste of the cake. Our cakes are both 
		beautiful and delicious; the cakes aren't dried out and the icing isn't heavy and greasy. And, our prices
		are very tough to beat. Let us "bake" your day perfect by creating that special wedding cake, grooms cake,
		or anniversary cake you and your family deserve. Since 1958 our family has been producing high quality 
		cakes at affordable prices. Everything is baked right here, by our family, for your family. We look forward
		to giving you extraordinary taste, beauty, and service!
