We offer simple delicious lunches on your choice of bread, and always served with a fresh baked cookie, chips, and a pickle spear! Your choice of American Cheese or White Swiss Cheese available at no additional charge. A few of our sandwiches include;

Our Famous Chicken Salad Sandwich
All white meat boneless, skinless chicken breast, seasoned just right and oven roasted right here. Then we add walnuts, red seedless grapes, celery, and just the right amount of mayo, for a fresh, tasty experience. Also available by weight, so you can take it one and make sandwiches for your family.

Honey Ham Sandwich
Thin sliced Honey Ham with no fillers and just a touch of sweetness. Try it on a fresh baked croissant and you'll be calling it "Heavenly Ham"...

Oven Roasted Turkey Sandwich
All freshly sliced breast of turkey with a touch of smokiness to tempt your taste buds. We suggest a toasted Whole Wheat bread with Spicy Mustard, lettuce and tomato....yummy!

Deli Style Chicken Sandwich
Thinly sliced all white meat chicken breast, try it on a bagel for an extra special treat! (Bagels not always available)

We also serve daily specials like Corned Beef, Roast Beef, BBQ Chicken Sandwiches, as well as old fashioned Chicago style Ho Dogs on the weekend (Fri & Sat) limited to availability....

And be sure to try our signature soups, which vary daily. Soup choices include, but are not limited to Chicken Pot Pie, Broccoli Cheddar, Gourmet Tomato, Cheese Burger, and our exclusive (and favorite) Taco Soup! We change soups daily, as well as with the seasons...

All our lunch items are available to go, or dine in. We also do larger catering box lunches. Call for pricing or to place your order!
