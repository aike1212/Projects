1. home page:
a. the jquery needs to be set bigger. There are white spaces on
the left and bottom sides of the screen and this also appears bigger when viewed
in chrome. Please make adjustments so it fits the screen perfectly

b. bar for footer should be at the bottom of the page. right now it is placed
2 inches above where it should be. Please fix.

c. logo, please change it to the logo found here

(logo should not have any white background. )
