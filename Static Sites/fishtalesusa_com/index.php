    <p><br />Here at Fish Tales, we use only the freshest food products and let our customers do the talking.....or as some call it bragging. Aside from our restaurant location, you may still see our food trucks on the road heading to a catering event or even a charity event we support. We are very dedicated to the communities we serve and make this a staple of our business.</p>
 	<p>At Fishtales we understand our local schools as well as Police and Military need our support. We are a firm supporter of 
the USO and local schools ROTC programs.</p>
